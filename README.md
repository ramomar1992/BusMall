## Lab 11-15 Code-Fellows amman-201 class

This new repository is to solve Labs 11 - 15 from Amman 201 class. 

It is a website that shows 25 groups of featured products' pics to viewers and allow them to choose one of them at a time. Then it will output the results to the user.

This will help the BusMall startup to determine which products will appear in their proshoures which are going to be available in city buses.
